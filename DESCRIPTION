Description: The package provides a set of Bayes factors
    for testing statistical hypotheses. The package is
    intented for applied quantitative researchers in the
    social and behavioral sciences, medical research,
    and related fields. The Bayes factor tests can be
    executed for statistical models such as 
    univariate and multivariate normal linear models,
    generalized linear models, special cases of 
    linear mixed models, survival models, relational
    event models. Parameters that can be tested are
    location parameters (e.g., regression coefficients),
    variances (e.g., group variances), and measures of 
    association (e.g,. bivariate correlations).
