[![CRAN Version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/BFpack)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BFpack)
[![Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/BGGM)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BFpack)

The `R` package **BFpack** contains a set of functions for Bayesian exploratory (e.g., equal vs negative vs postive) and confirmatory (equality and/or order constraints) hypothesis testing under commonly used statistical models, including Bayesian t testing, Bayesian (M)AN(C)OVA, multivariate/univariate linear regression, Bayesian correlation analysis, Bayesian multilevel analysis, or Bayesian generalized linear models (e.g., logistic regression). The main function `BF` needs a fitted model (e.g., an object of class `lm` for a linear regression model) and (optionally) the argument `hypothesis`, a string which specifies a set of equality/order constraints on the parameters. By applying the function `get_estimates`on a fitted model, the names of the parameters are returned on which constrained hypotheses can be formulated. Bayes factors and posterior probabilities are computed for the hypotheses of interest.


## Installation

Install the latest release version of `BFpack` from CRAN:

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("BFpack")
```

The current developmental version can be installed with	

```{r, eval = FALSE}	
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) {	
  install.packages("remotes")	
}	
remotes::install_github("jomulder/BFpack")
```


## Illustrative Examples

Below several example analyses are provided using **BFpack**.


### Bayesian t testing

First a classical one sample t test is executed for the test value $\mu = 5$ on the therapeutic data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ttest1 <- t_test(therapeutic, alternative = "greater", mu = 5)
```

By default `BF` executes an exehaustive test around the null value of $H_1:\mu=5$ versus $H_2:\mu<5$ versus $H_3:\mu>5$ assuming equal prior probabilities for $H_1$, $H_2$, and $H_3$ of $\frac{1}{3}$.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
BF1 <- BF(ttest1)
```

The same test would be executed when the hypotheses would be explicitly formulated using the `hypothesis` argument.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
hypotheses <- "mu = 5; mu < 5; mu > 5"
BF1 <- BF(ttest1, hypothesis = hypotheses)
```
